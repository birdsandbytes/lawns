<h2> We can make a difference! </h2>
<h1> When it comes to lawns, our culture's ideal is a monospecific, close-cropped expanse of bright green.</h1>
<h1> Research shows that when lawns are mowed less frequently and are inhabited by a variety of grasses, clovers, and other plants, they are much more useful to wildlife.</h1>
<h1> Lawn chemicals don't simply kill weeds- they also kill beneficial insects and the animals that eat them. </h1>
<h1> If the homeowners make diverse, chemical-free lawns popular, they could become the new norm.</h1>
<h1> It's up to us. <h1>
